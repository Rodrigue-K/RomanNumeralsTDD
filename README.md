## My Approach

Through prior knowledge, I realised there are a few edge cases here which I had to account for. I made sure to write down the edge cases I was aware of at the beginning so as not to miss anything.

I also wanted to gain some learnings from my coding process here, I decided to record my coding session and uploaded it to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NK3IQhl71Zs&t=3s)
